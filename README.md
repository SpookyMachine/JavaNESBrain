# JavaNESBrain

A fork of the HalfNES Java NES Emulator that includes a Neural Network learning algorithm based on SethBling's MarI/O Lua script to enable the emulator to learn how to play itself.

Dependencies for Windows x64 are included in the 'lib' and 'natives' folders

(Still a WIP - build is currently failing due to LUA that has not been converted)
