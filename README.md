# JavaNESBrain

A fork of the BJNE Java NES Emulator that includes a Neural Network learning algorithm based on SethBling's MarI/O Lua script to enable the emulator to learn how to play itself.  (Eclipse .project file already included, but you can use any IDE)

No dependencies (besides Java) are required to run this

####Instructions
Run the main function in the 'SuperBrain' class.  Once the emulator opens, use the 'open' button in the GUI menu to run the NES ROM of your choice.  Use the keyboard to press 'Enter' and start a level.  Then, use the 'Start AI' button in the GUI menu and your keyboard controls will be relinquished to the evolving neural network.
